Types which zero values can be represented with nil
The zero values of the following types can be represented with nil.

Type (T)	Size Of T(nil)
	pointer	1 word
	slice	3 words
	map	1 word
	channel	1 word
	function	1 word
	interface	2 words
(One word means 4 bytes on 32bits OSes and 8 bytes on 64bits OSes. and the indirect underlying parts of a value don't contribute to the size of the value.)

The size of a zero value of a type is the same as any other values of the same type.
